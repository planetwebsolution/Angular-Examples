# Angular-examples

We've used angular version 1.3.15 for this app. Basically it was designed to split test campaigns. 
Where seller can set his campaigns and interchange it with another campaign. Which means redirect some ratio
of HTTP request to another campaign. The section will provide an option 
to the seller where he can set the ratio in percentage to change it with another campaign. So HTTP requests 
going to divert as per given ratio percent. It will help seller to understand which camapign is running most and what
is demanding. To promote a new campaign, it's the one of the finest way.
